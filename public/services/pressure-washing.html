            Hot Pressure Washing-Hot pressure washing is the most effective way to remove difficult grease and oil form your 
            building that can devalue a property and make a million dollar investment look significantly less attractive. 
            
            <p>Hot pressure washing employs the use of an electric motor with a kerosene burner that heats the water as it ejects it 
            through the spray nozzle. The heated stream then efficiently breaks down tough grease and oil that would sit and 
            ruin your property otherwise. Conventional cold pressure washing is used to wash away the dirt from the exterior 
            of your building, property, home or office.

            appreciate the value of that property at an affordable cost to you. The use of hot/cold pressure washing is one 
            surefire way to add life and value to your building and ensure that the curb appeal of your home or office remains strong.
