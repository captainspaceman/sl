        <h3>Sunland’s Superhero “Grime Fighters”</h3>
            <p>For the second year in a row, the Sunland team donned superhero costumes and took to the skies to clean some windows and lift some spirits of the kids at The Mattel Children’s Hospital UCLA. What started as a way to cheer up some sick kids turned into a great story that has since become a big part of the Sunland Window Cleaning business: Making our community a cleaner and happier place, any way that we can.</p>
        <p>Check back here regularly for more updates on when Sunland Window Cleaning’s next Superhero Day will be.</p>
